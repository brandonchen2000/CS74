test_classify.py and classify.py are the main files to look at

classify.py trains on the entire training csv and produces predictions for the test data, using the sentiment analysis from test_classify.py

sa.py is our rough isolated sentiment analysis code

model.py is our rough overall model testing code

filter.py is an additional file with first steps toward further reviewer screening

Anaboost.py uses anaboost and decision trees on the numerical features
